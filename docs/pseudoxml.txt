The format output by the decoder for the primary AIS messages is a pseudo-XML format that looks like the following:

<AISMessage MMSI="NNNNNNNNN" ID="NN"> - where ID is the AIS message ID and MMSI should be self-explanatory.
<Timestamp>NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN</Timestamp> - UTC timestamp in POSIX (seconds & microseconds since 1970) format.

The rest is for an example message, one that indicates position (Messages 01 - 04):

<Latitude>42.0N</Latitude>
<Longitude>63.75W</Longitude> - Negative Longitudes map to degrees West, positive ones map to degrees East
<Speed>9kn</Speed>
<Heading>14deg</Heading> - This is the arccosine against North, according to the AIS spec. (However it's unclear on whether it's true North or Magnetic North).
</AISMessage>

The format output by the decoder for profiling data is very simple, it is a CSV file with the following columns:
MMSI, Julian Day Number, Hours:Minutes:Seconds,
value of d_phase from the matched filter decoder at the start of decode of this transmission,
value of d_freq from the matched filter decoder at the start of decode of this transmission
